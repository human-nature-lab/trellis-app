# Trellis 3.0.22

*2018-12-18*

---

- Date questions now use the selected locale
- Respondent geo question types only allow respondents to be added to geo types specified by the "geo_type" parameter. The Building and Village geo types have been added in Trellisprod and Trellisdev. 
- Now checking if the server IP is valid before storing the configured IP. This makes it harder to misconfigure the app.
- Re-enabled adding photos in the new respondent and new geo forms
- Updated translations
- Fixed transaction bug
