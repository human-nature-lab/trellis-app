# Trellis 3.0.21

*2018-12-13*

---

- Fixed bug that broke the "Add location" functionality in 3.0.19
- Fixed skip bug with respondent condition tags 
  - This was caused by reloading a form in progress and changing the response to a question which assigned a respondent condition tag. The respondent condition tag was not being removed correctly when the response changed and caused a skip issue.
- Added embedded changelog
- Added expandable location history. Before respondent locations were being collapsed into a single location representing their current or last location, but now they can see the history of places they've been.
- Small bug fixes / UI updates throughout the app
