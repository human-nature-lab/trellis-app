# Studies
Data in Trellis is compartmentalized into studies. The studies page can be used to create, modify and remove studies. Click the "+" button in the top right corner to create a new study. Each study should have at least one language assigned to it.

## Study languages
Each study can support one or more languages. Forms can be translated into multiple languages, but languages must be assigned to the study before they can be translated. Removing a language from a study won't permanently delete the translations associated with that language. Existing translations will return when the language is added back to the study. Each study has a default language which is the language that will be used unless the respondent chooses a different language to respond in.
