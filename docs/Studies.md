# Studies
Data in Trellis is compartmentalized into studies. The studies page can be used to create, modify and remove 
studies. Click the "+" button in the top right corner to create a new study. Each study should have at least 
one language assigned to it.

## Study languages
Each study can support one or more languages. Forms can be translated into multiple languages, but languages 
must be assigned to the study before they can be translated. Removing a language from a study won't permanently 
delete the translations associated with that language. Existing translations will return when the language is 
added back to the study. Each study has a default language which is the language that will be used unless the 
respondent chooses a different language to respond in.
