# Users
The users view allows privileged users to add, remove and modify users in the system. In Trellis, a user is someone who has the ability to administer surveys on behalf of a respondent. Depending on a user's role, they may also be able to add and modify forms, studies, languages, locations, etc.

Trellis is a distributed, offline system which means that a full [sync](../Glossary#sync), will be required for any changes to users to get sent to a mobile device.

## Adding users
To add a user click the **plus** icon in the top right corner of the page. This will open a dialog that has the required fields for a new user. Once all of the fields are filled out, click **save** to create the user.

#### Name
The real name of the user.
#### Username
The name used to login to Trellis.
#### Role
The role of the user controls what they have access to.
- **Surveyor** - A surveyor has the ability to administer forms on behalf of a respondent. They cannot make changes to forms or manage other parts of the system. 
- **Supervisor** - The supervisor has slightly elevated permissions compared to the surveyor.
- **Admin** - The admin has access to everything. This role should be reserved for few people.
#### Password
The intial password for that surveyor. All users can change their password to whatever they would like.

## Editing users
To edit a user, click the **edit** icon near that user. The dialog will look nearly identical to the create user dialog, but the password field will be gone. Make any edits to the user and click **save** to finish the edits.

## Removing users
To remove a user, click the **delete** icon for that user. You will be required to confirm the deletion before it will occur.
