will be hidden and the map will be resized to fit an A4 page in portrait mode. Turn off print margins to fit the 
map on one page. Clicking the print button again (or refreshing the page) will turn print mode off.

  moving the location and return to the previous menu options.
  - <i class="icon material-icons black--text">edit</i>: Click the **rename** button to rename the selected
