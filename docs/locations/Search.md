# Location search
The location search page will display top-level locations (locations without a parent location) by default. 
Click a location to display its contained child locations (if any). Click the up arrows 
(<i class="icon material-icons black--text">arrow_upward</i>) to return to the parent location.

Typing in the **Search** field will filter the displayed locations by name.

These search terms will all display a location named "Alta Vista":
- alta v
- a v
- lta ista
