# Location search
At the start, the location search page will only display top-level locations (locations without a parent location). 
Click a location to display its contained child locations (if any). Click the up arrows to return to the parent 
location.

Typing in the **Search** field will filter the displayed locations by name.

These search terms will all display a location named "Alta Vista":
- alta v
- a v
- lta ista

### Icons 
  - <i class="icon material-icons">map</i>: Clicking the map icon will redirect you to the [[map view|Map.md]] showing all of the children for that location.
  - <i class="icon material-icons">info</i>: Clicking the info icon will redirect you to the [[information page|Geo-info.md]] for that location.
