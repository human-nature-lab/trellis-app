# Location Forms
This page shows all of the forms which are available for this location.

### Starting
Forms which have not been started will have a grey (<i class="icon material-icons">play_circle_outline</i>) icon next to them.
If the form has been started but not finished, the icon will appear as (<i class="icon material-icons primary--text">query_builder</i>)

To start a form click on the (<i class="icon material-icons">play_circle_outline</i>) button to start a new survey. If a survey
has already started, click (<i class="icon material-icons">keyboard_arrow_down</i>) and then click on the interview that you
