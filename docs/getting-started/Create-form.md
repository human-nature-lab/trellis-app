# Creating a form

1. Click Forms in the main menu. 
2. There are two different tables: Forms, and Census Forms.
    * Forms: these are standard forms used for data collection. They will appear in the Forms menu associated with each
      respondent in your study.
    * Census Forms: these forms are automatically started when certain actions are taken by the surveyor, including: 
      adding a respondent to the study, adding a location to the study, moving a respondent, renaming a respondent, or
      adding an associated respondent. 
3. Click the plus (<i class="icon material-icons black--text">add</i>) icon in the upper right of the table of the form 
   type you wish to create.
4. Click the pencil (<i class="icon material-icons black--text">edit</i>) icon, edit the name of the form, and click the
   save (<i class="icon material-icons black--text">save</i>) icon. Select the language in the drop down menu to 
   translate the form's display name.
5. *If you are creating a census form, select the event that will trigger the display of this form in the "Census type" 
   drop-down list.
6. Open the actions (<i class="icon material-icons black--text">more_vert</i>) menu and click the pencil icon to open
   the form builder. See the [form builder documentation](../form-builder/Introduction.md) for instructions for editing
   your form.
7. When you have finished editing the form, return to the forms page and check the "Published" checkbox to activate the 
   form for your study.
