# Form builder

A form is a collection of questions arranged into pages and sections. The questions collect data while the pages and 
sections control which questions are presented to the respondent. Specifically, pages control the visibility of 
questions on a per-page basis while sections control how many times a questions are repeated.

## Getting started
1. Click the "Add Section" button and enter the name of your first section. A section is used to organize questions by 
   subject matter. Sections may also be used to repeat a series of questions or ask follow-up questions about previously 
   entered question responses. [Click for more about sections.](Sections.md)  

2. At the bottom of your new section, click the "Add Page" button to add your first page of questions. In the Trellis 
   app, clicking the "Next" button will navigate between the current page of questions and the next page. Pages may be 
   shown or hidden based on conditions assigned by previously answered questions. [Click for more about pages.](Pages.md) 

3. Click the "Add Question" button at the bottom of the page and fill out the dialog with the question text, variable 
   name, and question type in order to add your first question to your form. You may want to add multiple questions to 
   the same page if they are shorter or related questions, otherwise, click the "Add Page" button to separate questions 
   by a "Next" button in the app. [Click for more about questions.](Pages.md)
