# Form sections
A section is a collection of pages of questions identified by a title. To change the title, select the desired study
language using the drop-down menu to the left of the title and edit the title as desired. The edited title will be saved
automatically.

To delete a form section, click the "x" button to the right of the section title. Deleting a form section will also
delete any contained pages and questions.

To reorder form sections, click the arrows icon in the upper-left corner and drag the section to the desired 
location. It may be easier to reorder sections after minimizing them by clicking the "-" icon in the upper-right
corner.

## Repeated sections
Click the "Repeat" checkbox in order to make a section repeated. At the end of a repeated section the surveyor will be 
asked if they want to repeat the section if the maximum number of repetitions (if any) have not already been 
administered. To change the dialog text of the repeat prompt, type the text in the input provided changing the study 
language in the drop-down to translate the prompt.

## Follow up sections
Follow up sections allow you to ask a series of questions about answers given in preceding questions (most commonly 
roster, relationship, and multiple-select). The question you are following up on must be in a different section. After 
adding the question you want to follow up on, click the "Follow up" checkbox and select the variable name of the 
question in the drop down list. Checking the "Randomize order" checkbox will randomize the order in which the responses 
are followed up on.
