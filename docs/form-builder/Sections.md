# Form sections
A section is a collection of pages of questions identified by a title. To change the title, select the desired study
language using the drop-down menu to the left of the title and edit the title as desired. The edited title will be saved
automatically.

To delete a form section, click the "x" button to the right of the section title. Deleting a form section will also
delete any contained pages and questions.

To reorder form sections, click the arrows icon in the upper-left corner and drag the section to the desired 
location. It may be easier to reorder sections after minimizing them by clicking the "-" icon in the upper-right
corner.

## Repeated sections
Click the "Repeat" checkbox in order to make a section a repeated section. At the end of a repeated section the surveyor 
will be prompted to repeat the section if the maximum number of repetitions (if any) have not already been met. To 
change the dialog text of the repeat prompt, type the text in the input provided changing the study language in the 
drop-down to translate the prompt.
