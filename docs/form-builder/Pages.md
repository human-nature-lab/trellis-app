# Form pages

All questions contained within the same page will be displayed together. This may be useful if the questions are linked 
(e.g. asking for a number followed by a unit of measure), or if a series of questions all have the same set-up text.

To delete a page, click the "x" to the right of the "Page X" text. Deleting a page will also delete any contained 
questions.

To change the display order of pages within a section click the arrow icon in the upper-left corner of the page and drag
the page to the desired location in the section. It may be easier to reorder the pages after minimizing the pages by 
clicking the "-" icon in the upper-right corner.

## Page skips

A page of questions may be conditionally shown or hidden based on conditions that were previously
assigned based on responses to previous questions. The steps for adding a page skip are:

1.  Click the "Add Skip" button on the page you want to conditionally show.
2.  Add the [skip logic](../Skips.md) using custom JavaScript or Hide/Show logic.


For more information, go to the section on [condition assignment](Conditions.md).
