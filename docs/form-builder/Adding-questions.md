# Adding questions
Before you can add a question, you have to add at least one section and page. This is done by clicking the "Add section" and "Add page" buttons in the form builder.

Once you've created a page to hold the form you can add a question. 
1. Click on the "Add question" button
1. Add the question text. If you have multiple languages, this will be assigned as the default language for your study.
1. Add a unique question variable name. This is used to identify the data collected by this question in the reports.
1. Add the question type. Several different types of questions are supported (see [question types](Question-types.md) for more details), but the simplest question type is the "text" question type.
1. Click "Create"
