# Storage
This module will be used to manage the files and databases used by Trellis.

### Backup database
If you are using the Trellis Proxy server it is possible to upload a full backup of the mobile database
used by the device. This can be helpful for debugging purposes if it is done prior to downloading a snapshot.
Upload the backup of the database by clicking (<i class="mdi mdi-dots-vertical"></i>) and then selecting
"Backup database". Transferring a large database over a slow network can take several minutes.
