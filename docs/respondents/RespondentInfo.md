# Respondent info
Each respondent in Trellis has their own page. This page allows a user to view, add and remove data 
for a single respondent.

### Forms
In the top right there is a link to the respondent's forms page. 
See [respondent forms](RespondentForms.md) for more information.

### Photos
All of the photos associated with this respondent will appear in this first section. In the mobile app, 
photos can be added by clicking the "+" button in the top right corner of the photos section. This will
open the camera on the device so that a photo can be taken. Taking photos is not currently supported on
the web.

### Locations
A respondent can be assigned to one or more locations in Trellis. These locations can be modified directly
from this section. Click the "+" button in the top right corner of this section to create a new location. If
a respondent needs to be moved, click the (<i class="icon mdi mdi-pencil"></i>) icon next to
the location which should be moved to start moving the respondent. This action triggers a census

### Condition tags
All of the respondent condition tags that have been assigned to the respondent will show up in this section.
For more information about condition tags and what they can be used for, 
[see this page](../form-builder/Conditions.md).

### Names
Respondents can have more than one name in Trellis. This feature is designed to make it simple to survey 
populations which may use informal names. Adding multiple names to a respondent allows researchers to keep 
track of nicknames, phonetic versions of names and different spellings of names in different languages. All
of the names assigned to a respondent are searchable.

### Respondent fills
Respondent fills are key/value pairs that are associated with a respondent. These are values which need to be
available in the context of a survey. They can be accessed within a survey in the same way as other 
[interpolated values](../form-builder/InterpolatedValues.md).

### Admin
If a user has the correct permissions, they can view the "Admin" section for this respondent. This section allows
a user to permanently delete a single respondent from the database.
