# Add new respondent

### Add the respondent's name
Enter the respondent's full name in the **Full name** field. You can add additional names (aliases, alternate spellings) 
on the respondent info page after adding the respondent. 

After entering the name, click the **Continue** button.

### Take a photo of the respondent
Tap the plus (<i class="icon material-icons">more_vert</i>) button to add one or more photos of the respondent. Click 
the star icon (<i class="icon material-icons">star_border</i>) to choose the default photo to display. Click the menu 
button (<i class="icon material-icons">more_vert</i>) to add notes or delete photos.

*Note: adding photos is currently (as of v3.0.23) unimplemented for the web app. Photos must be added using the tablet 
app.*

When you have finished adding photos, click the **Continue** button.

### Completing the census form
If there is a census form associated with adding a new respondent, you will be redirected to the form. If you cannot 
complete the form at this time, tap the **Exit** button to leave the form. You can continue any unfinished census forms 
from the respondent forms page. 

If there is no respondent census form you will be redirected to the respondent search form.
