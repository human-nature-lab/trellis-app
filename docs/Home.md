# Trellis documentation
## About
Trellis is a suite of software tools for developing, administering, and collecting survey and 
social network data. Trellis sets itself apart from other survey tools with its support for mapping 
social networks using a photographic census and its ability to work offline in remote areas.

You can use Trellis to conduct a photographic census of the respondent population in sociocentric 
study designs. Then it's possible to document the edges of the network by asking customized "name 
generator" questions such as "With whom do you discuss important matters?"

An especially valuable feature of Trellis is that the respondents can identify their social 
contacts not only by name, but by photograph. This allows for accurate mapping of social networks 
even in low-literacy populations or where names may be similar or confusing.
