# Trellis documentation
## About
Trellis is a suite of software tools for developing, administering, and collecting survey and social network data. 
What separates Trellis from other survey tools is its support for mapping social networks and its ability to
integrate them with survey data. Additionally, Trellis can be used for both online and offline data collection 
via any browser window or a mobile app.

You can use Trellis to conduct a photographic census of the respondent population in sociocentric study designs. 
Then it's possible to document the edges of the network by asking customized "name generator" questions such as 
"With whom do you discuss important matters?"

An especially valuable feature of Trellis is that the respondents can identify their social contacts not only by 
name, but by photograph. This allows for accurate mapping of social networks even in low-literacy populations or 
where names may be similar or confusing.
